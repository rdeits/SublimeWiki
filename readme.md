Sublime Wiki
------------
A simple way to maintain a personal wiki in Sublime Text 2. 

This extension isn't designed to replace wikipedia, or even go on the web at all. This is a flat-file, no-nesting, no-nonsense system designed purely to give you (well, me) a place to catch fleeting thoughts and turn them into something useful. To keep it as fiddle-proof as possible, the list of features is intentionally kept very small.

In other words, It's job is to let you maintain a *personal* wiki without spending too much time on it. 
Thanks to Andy Hunt for the inspiration. If you haven't yet, I strongly recommend you read [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning][pragLearn] for more excellent tips on how to really use your brain.
